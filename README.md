# screen-lock-password
This was supposed to be a password protected transparent screen lock. The password part works fine, but the screen locking part is very limited (does not cover the taskbar and can be minimized from taskbar, also can be alt-tabbed and so on).
Not full transparency is implemented on purpose for evaluation.
